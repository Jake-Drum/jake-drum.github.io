I am a CPA and financial planner. I work as a fiduciary for all of my clients to help them minimize taxes and reach their financial goals. I specialize in tax preparation and financial planning for real estate investors, the self-employed, and anyone looking to reach financial independence. 

### My investing philosophy is simple:
 **Invest** as much as possible, **diversify** those investments, and **Save** money by taking adavantage of low cost, tax smart investments.
